## InfoSec Notes & Writeups

Repos like these are doomed to be depreceated. This repo is a place for the *actual* notes I take, for *when* I need to take them, So I can reference them easily. Maybe you'll find somthing Helpful in it, idk.

If your looking for a repo with thorough reference notes on general InfoSec things, [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/) and [Cheatsheet-God](https://github.com/OlivierLaflamme/Cheatsheet-God) are really good.
